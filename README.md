# vue-okta-vuex-vuetify

A simple project to show Vue + Vuex + Okta (+ Vuetify).

You need to configure Okta.com, and then add those values to /src/router/index.js

This closely follows the Okta-Vue guide, but adds the use of Vuex.

There may be a better way to make use Vue+Vuex+Okta, but I couldn't find an example. Please submit PRs to improve!!
